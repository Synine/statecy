# `statecy` Finite State Machine

Statecy FSM has the following ideals that we follow:

1. FSM is modifiable so long as it's not running (all modififcation methods will error-out if it's initialized).

2. Re-initialization after an FSM is initialized, will result in an exception (TODO: consider whether to silently move to initial state, TODO: add \[project\] issue)

PLACEHOLDER  - TODO: documentation (methods, examples)
