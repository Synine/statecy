# Statecy States

For Statecy, all states need to be added first, before we can set anything up.

```json
{
    "states": [
        "A",
        "B",
        "C",
        "D",
        "E",
        "F",
        "G",
        "H"
    ],
    /* initial state is A, A NEEDS to be there in "states" */
    "initial": "A"
}
```
